<p class="intro">Dietry restrictions should not be a worry in this type of cupcakes.The draw their sweet flavour and good appearance from the power of cocoa and beets.
  <br>They are super healthy and at the sametime delicious. What a delicacy! The following is the procedure to prepare beet cupcakes:</br></p>

<h2>Recipe</h2>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 medium beet (you'll need 1/2 cup pur√©ed as original recipe is written</li>
      <li>1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk</li>
      <li>1 tsp white or apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup raw turbinado OR granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup avocado or melted coconut oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 heaping cup whole-wheat pastry flour or unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 scant cup unsweetened cocoa powder (plus more for topping)</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
   </ul>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

    <ol>
     <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C), remove the stem and most of the root from your beets, and scrub and wash them underwater until clean.</li>
     <li>Wrap beet(s) in foil, drizzle on a bit of olive or avocado oil, wrap tightly, and roast for one hour or until a knife inserted falls out without resistance.
         <br>They should be tender. Set in the fridge (in a bowl to catch juice) to cool to room temperature.</br></li>
     <li>Once cooled, either finely grate or puree beets in a <em>small blender</em> (adding orange juice or water to encourage mixing).
         <br>Measure out 1/2 cup and set aside (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Reserve the rest for things like <em>beet hummus!</em></br></li>
     <li>Line a muffin pan with paper liners.</li>
     <li>Whisk together the almond milk and vinegar in a large bowl, and set aside for a few minutes to curdle.
         <br>Add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup beets (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and beat until foamy.</br></li>
     <li>Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a sifter and slowly sift it into the wet ingredients while mixing with a hand-held or standing mixer.
         <br>Beat until no large lumps remain.</br></li>
     <li>Pour batter into liners, filling 3/4 of the way full. Bake 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
         <br>Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely. Do not try and unwrap them or they'll stick to the wrapper.</br></li>
     <li>Once cooled, dust with cocoa powder and store in an airtight container to keep fresh.</li>
